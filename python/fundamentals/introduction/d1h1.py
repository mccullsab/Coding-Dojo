# Challenge 1:
#   Fill in the missing code for the full_name function.
#   Be sure to add the 2 parameters (and name them appropriately)
#   Return the full name to get the desired output!

def full_name(first, last):
    full = (f"{first} {last}")
    return(full)
    # your code here!

name1 = full_name("Eddie", "Aikau")
print(name1) # should print Eddie Aikau

name2 = full_name("Abby", "M")
print(name2)

# Challenge 2: 
#   Call the function again using your own name and print the results!
